## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

release.io is available as an API system that can be integrated into an existing server on a different port or deployed as a stand-alone microservice. A custom frontend is needed to access the Dashboard as of now.

#### Prerequisites

- **Go (Golang):** Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

- **SQLite3:** release.io requires SQLite3. If not already installed, download it from [https://www.sqlite.org/download.html](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

#### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired installation directory. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/coderGtm/release.io.git
```

#### Set Environment Variables

1. Locate the `demo.env` file in the project directory.
2. Open `demo.env` and fill in the required environment variables.
3. Rename `demo.env` to `.env`. This step now protects the file via `.gitignore`.

#### Download Go Modules

Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:

```shell
go mod tidy
```

#### Run the Application

Start the application with the following command:

```shell
go run .
```

#### Access the Application

By default, the application (API) runs on port 8080. You can access it via Postman or curl with the base URL [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). A very bare-bones and rather "incomplete" frontend is provided in the [frontend](frontend) directory which is routed to the base url scheme, i.e. you can access it via [http://localhost:8080/signup](http://localhost:8080/signup) scheme. It is **highly reccomended and maybe necessary** that you develop your custom frontend, while taking reference from what is provided. _As a side note, it would be great if you can update the frontend in this repo with your improved version._


## üöÄ Deployment

You can change the port on which the service runs by modifying the `PORT` value in your environment config file (`.env`).

## üöß How It Works:

### 1. User Registration and Authentication:

Users register for an account, providing the necessary authentication credentials.

### 2. Creating and Managing Apps:

Once logged in, users can create and manage their applications, defining specific attributes and settings.

### 3. Versioning and Release Notes:

Within each application, users can create and manage multiple releases. For each release, they can attach release notes in their preferred format (text, MD, HTML).

### 4. Browsing and Exporting Release Notes:

Users can easily browse and view release notes associated with their applications. Additionally, they have the option to export notes in their chosen format.

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- ### Efficient Documentation: 
    release.io streamlines the process of creating, updating, and managing release notes, saving valuable time for developers and product teams.

- ### Customizable Formats:
    The system accommodates different documentation styles with support for text, md, and HTML formats, catering to a wide range of user preferences.

- ### Organized Versioning:
    Through intuitive version management, users can easily track the evolution of their applications and associated release notes.

- ### Enhanced Collaboration:
    The user management feature ensures that only authorized individuals have access, promoting secure collaboration within teams.
